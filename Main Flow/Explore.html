              <details style="margin-top: -5px; margin-bottom: 10px">
                The remarkable thing about Harihar Fort Trek is that it appears
                to be rectangular from the base village. However, it is built on
                a triangular prism of rock. The rock edges are vertical, which
                makes this ancient fort stand apart. Because of these vertical
                steps, the trek is the most popular in all of the Sahyadri
                Range. Although the trek to Harihar Fort or Harihar killa is
                relatively short, it is rather difficult. Your guide will be
                included to help you throughout your journey. These rock-cut
                stairs, which make up the last 200 feet of the trip, make for a
                nerve-wracking climb. It has a total of 200 steps and an
                80-degree elevation. Because of the steep climb down and
                500-foot drop at one point, the descent is extremely thrilling.
                The stair's architecture is both diverse and impressive. The
                valley below can be seen in a spectacular and sometimes
                frightening way.

                pilgrimage in Maharashtra, and among the top places to visit as
                part of the Solapur tour. Swami Samarth Temple is the final
                abode of Sri Swami Samarth Maharaj, a 19th-century saint who is
                believed to be an incarnation of Lord Dattatreya by his
                devotees. He is also believed to be a reincarnation of Narasimha
                Saraswati, another earlier spiritual master of the Dattatreya
                sect. Swami Samarth is also known by different names, such as
                'Akkalkot Swami, Akalkot Maharaj, Maharaj of Akalkot, and
                Akalkot Niwasi Maharaj. According to Swami Samarth himself, he
                had originally appeared in the Kardali forests near Srisailam, a
                holy town in Andhra Pradesh. Later, he migrated to different
                places. Sri Swami Samarth probably arrived at Akkalkot in 1856
                on receiving an invitation from Chintopant Tol and then stayed
                there for about 22 years. Sri Swami Samartha Maharaj left his
                mortal body in 1878, but his legacy continues to inspire and
                guide people around the world. The holy Samadhi of Swamiji is
                located in the house of his disciple Cholappa, in the place
                already reserved for it before his bodily demise. This temple is
                also called Vatavruksha Swami Mandir because of the presence of
                the huge banyan tree (Vatavruksha).
